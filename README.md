# Fit Coach: Your AI-Powered Fitness Trainer 🤖🏋️‍♂️

Fit Coach is an innovative application that delivers personalized fitness coaching, fueled by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This powerful capability allows our AI-driven coach to formulate customized training plans and dietary suggestions based on users' encrypted training data and body metrics, all while safeguarding their privacy. With Fit Coach, your fitness journey becomes more informed, personalized, and secure.

## Understanding the Challenge ⚠️

In an age where health and fitness are paramount, many individuals struggle to find effective and personal coaching that respects their privacy. Traditional fitness applications often require users to share sensitive personal data, leading to concerns about data security and privacy breaches. Furthermore, generic training plans do not cater to individual needs, ultimately reducing motivation and results.

## How Zama FHE Addresses These Issues 🔒

Fit Coach utilizes **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to keep your fitness data completely private while enabling our AI to generate tailored fitness solutions. By leveraging Zama's open-source libraries, including **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, we ensure that user data is not exposed during the computation process. This means your body metrics, workout history, and dietary preferences remain secure while allowing for rich, personalized insights.

## Core Functionalities ⭐

- **Encrypted Fitness Data:** All user information remains FHE-encrypted, offering unparalleled privacy.
- **AI-Generated Training Plans:** Our sophisticated AI designs training regimens uniquely tailored to each user's goals and body metrics.

The Fit Coach application is built upon a robust tech stack, including:

- **Zama FHE SDK** - Confidential computing framework for secure data processing.
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side coding.
